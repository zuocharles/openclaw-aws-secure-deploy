# Step 5: Get Your Discord User ID

> **TODO:** Add screenshots for each step below

---

## Overview

Your Discord User ID is a unique number that identifies you. OpenClaw uses it to ensure only YOU can control the bot.

**Estimated time:** 2 minutes

---

## Step 5.1: Enable Developer Mode

1. Open Discord (web or app)
2. Click the gear icon (User Settings) next to your username
3. Scroll down and click "Advanced"
4. Toggle ON "Developer Mode"
5. Close settings

**[SCREENSHOT NEEDED]:** Discord settings with Developer Mode toggle enabled

---

## Step 5.2: Copy Your User ID

### Method 1: From Your Profile

1. Click on your own profile picture/avatar
2. Click the three dots menu (⋮)
3. Click "Copy User ID"

**[SCREENSHOT NEEDED]:** Profile menu with "Copy User ID" option

### Method 2: From a Message

1. Send a message in any server or DM
2. Right-click on your own username/message
3. Click "Copy User ID"

**[SCREENSHOT NEEDED]:** Right-click menu showing "Copy User ID"

## Step 5.3: Save Your User ID

Paste the ID somewhere temporarily - you'll need to enter it during setup.

It looks like a long number, for example: `1118908675717877760`

## 🎉 User ID Copied!

You now have your unique Discord User ID. This is used to:
- Configure the DM allowlist (so only you can message the bot)
- Set up the group policy (so the bot only responds to you)

**Next step:** [Invite bot to your server](06-discord-invite.md)

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see 'Copy User ID' option"
- Make sure Developer Mode is enabled (Step 5.1)
- Try restarting Discord
- Make sure you're clicking on your own name, not someone else's

### "The ID is different on mobile vs desktop"
- Your User ID is the same everywhere
- If they look different, one might be a message ID instead
- Always use the "Copy User ID" option, don't try to type it manually
