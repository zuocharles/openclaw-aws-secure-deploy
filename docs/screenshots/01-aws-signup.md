## Troubleshooting

### "My credit card was declined"
- Make sure the billing address matches your card
- Try a different card
- Contact your bank (they may block international transactions)

### "I didn't receive the verification SMS"
- Check your spam folder
- Try the "Call me" option instead
- Make sure your phone can receive international SMS

### "Account verification is taking too long"
- Sometimes AWS manually reviews new accounts
- Can take up to 24 hours
- You'll receive an email when approved
